My portfolio of projects and articles


## Statistical Learning
1. **Linear Regression**
This project introduces the theory behind linear regression, metrics such as r-squared, and the calculation of p-values and F-Statistics. For each of the concepts that are commonly applied through packages, it is shown how the behaviour/results from these packages compare to manual application of these concepts. It is shown how variable selection can be applied using the r-squared statistic iteratively. Finally, Cross Validation is applied, both manually as well as part of popular packages.

2. **Logistic Regression**
This project introduces the theory behind logistic regression, such as the calculation of p-values and F-Statistics. For each of the concepts that are commonly applied through packages, it is shown how the behaviour/results from these packages compare to manual application of these concepts.

3. **Bayesian Inference**
An application hypothesis testing using both Bayesian Inference with a Jeffreys Prior and usual T-Tests. Showing that these two approaches agree with each other as is the intention of such a prior.

4. **ML Applications**
Some applications of Machine Learning from various sources:
  - **Titanic** (Kaggle)
  - **Housing** (Kaggle)
  
5. **ML App**
A simple web app is created allowing a user to upload data and make a prediction. The distribution of the data as well as the prediction is shown to the user. The app uses Python/Flask. Currently, the app uses only LinearRegression on multiple predictors. However, more sophisticated models can be slotted in.

## Utilities
1. **CustomURIParser**
The application of proper source control as well as unit tests in order to create a URI parser with the ability to determine if a string is a valid URI, whether it be relative or absolute.
